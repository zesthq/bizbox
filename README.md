## What is Bizbox?

# Enterprise-grade orchestration for AI-powered organizations

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, Bizbox is the _company_**

Bizbox is an open-source, self-hosted Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business — built with enterprise teams in mind. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track your agents' work and costs from one secure, auditable dashboard.

It looks like a task manager — but under the hood it has org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, agent coordination, and the audit trails enterprises need.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

## Problems Bizbox solves

| Without Bizbox                                                                                                                     | With Bizbox                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ Bizbox gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in Bizbox. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                              |
| ❌ No audit trail when something goes wrong. No way to prove who authorized what.                                                     | ✅ Every action is logged in an immutable activity audit trail. Every agent action and board decision is traceable.                   |
| ❌ Sensitive company data leaves your infrastructure when using cloud-hosted AI orchestration tools.                                  | ✅ Fully self-hosted. Your data stays on your infrastructure. No external orchestration service has access.                           |

<br/>

## Why Bizbox is special

Bizbox handles the hard orchestration details correctly — and adds the enterprise-grade properties teams need.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn Bizbox workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                      |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-company isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |
| **Immutable audit trail.**        | Every agent action and board decision is durably logged — enabling compliance, forensics, and oversight.      |
| **Self-hosted and air-gappable.** | Run on your own infrastructure with no external dependencies. Data never leaves your environment.             |

<br/>

## What Bizbox is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Bizbox models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.            |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. Bizbox manages the organization they work in.               |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need Bizbox. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | Bizbox orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                       |

<br/>

## Quickstart

Open source. Self-hosted. No Bizbox account required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zesthq/bizbox.git
cd bizbox
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the API server at `http://localhost:3100`. An embedded PostgreSQL database is created automatically — no setup required.

> **Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+

### Authenticated / Enterprise Mode

For multi-user or network-accessible deployments:

```bash
pnpm dev --bind lan
# or for Tailscale:
pnpm dev --bind tailnet
```

See [doc/DOCKER.md](doc/DOCKER.md) for production Docker deployments and [doc/DEVELOPING.md](doc/DEVELOPING.md) for the full development guide.

<br/>

## FAQ

**What does a typical setup look like?**
Locally, a single Node.js process manages an embedded Postgres and local file storage. For production, point it at your own Postgres and deploy however you like. Configure projects, agents, and goals — the agents take care of the rest.

For enterprise deployments, use Docker Compose with an external PostgreSQL instance. See [doc/DOCKER.md](doc/DOCKER.md) for full deployment options.

**Can I run multiple companies?**
Yes. A single deployment can run an unlimited number of companies with complete data isolation.

**How is Bizbox different from agents like OpenClaw or Claude Code?**
Bizbox _uses_ those agents. It orchestrates them into a company — with org charts, budgets, goals, governance, and accountability.

**Why should I use Bizbox instead of just pointing my OpenClaw to Asana or Trello?**
Agent orchestration has subtleties in how you coordinate who has work checked out, how to maintain sessions, monitoring costs, establishing governance - Bizbox does this for you.

(Bring-your-own-ticket-system is on the Roadmap)

**Do agents run continuously?**
By default, agents run on scheduled heartbeats and event-based triggers (task assignment, @-mentions). You can also hook in continuous agents like OpenClaw. You bring your agent and Bizbox coordinates.

**Is Bizbox suitable for enterprise use?**
Yes. Bizbox is a fork of [paperclipai/paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) with an emphasis on enterprise usability: self-hosted deployment, complete data isolation, immutable audit trails, multi-user governance, cost controls, and on-premise compatibility. The architecture keeps your data on your own infrastructure with no external orchestration service required.

<br/>

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Full dev (API + UI, watch mode)
pnpm dev:once         # Full dev without file watching
pnpm dev:server       # Server only
pnpm build            # Build all
pnpm typecheck        # Type checking
pnpm test             # Cheap default test run (Vitest only)
pnpm verify:agent     # Standard Codex/agent hand-off check
pnpm verify:full      # Full pre-handoff verification
pnpm test:watch       # Vitest watch mode
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright browser suite
pnpm db:generate      # Generate DB migration
pnpm db:migrate       # Apply migrations
```

`pnpm test` does not run Playwright. Browser suites stay separate and are typically run only when working on those flows or in CI.

See [doc/DEVELOPING.md](doc/DEVELOPING.md) for the full development guide.
