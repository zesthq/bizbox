# ClipHub — The Company Registry

**Download a company.**

ClipHub is the public registry where people share, discover, and download Bizbox company configurations. A company template is a portable artifact containing an entire org — agents, reporting structure, adapter configs, role definitions, seed tasks — ready to spin up with one command.

---

## What It Is

ClipHub is to Bizbox what a package registry is to a programming language. Bizbox already supports exportable org configs (see [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) §2). ClipHub is the public directory where those exports live.

A user builds a working company in Bizbox — a dev shop, a marketing agency, a research lab, a content studio — exports the template, and publishes it to ClipHub. Anyone can browse, search, download, and spin up that company on their own Bizbox instance.

The tagline: **you can literally download a company.**

---

## What Gets Published

A ClipHub package is a **company template export** — the portable artifact format defined in the Bizbox spec. It contains:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Company metadata** | Name, description, intended use case, category |
| **Org chart** | Full reporting hierarchy — who reports to whom |
| **Agent definitions** | Every agent: name, role, title, capabilities description |
| **Adapter configs** | Per-agent adapter type and configuration (SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, CLAUDE.md, process commands, webhook URLs — whatever the adapter needs) |
| **Seed tasks** | Optional starter tasks and initiatives to bootstrap the company's first run |
| **Budget defaults** | Suggested token/cost budgets per agent and per company |

Templates are **structure, not state.** No in-progress tasks, no historical cost data, no runtime artifacts. Just the blueprint.

### Sub-packages

Not every use case needs a whole company. ClipHub also supports publishing individual components:

- **Agent templates** — a single agent config (e.g. "Senior TypeScript Engineer", "SEO Content Writer", "DevOps Agent")
- **Team templates** — a subtree of the org chart (e.g. "Marketing Team: CMO + 3 reports", "Engineering Pod: Tech Lead + 4 Engineers")
- **Adapter configs** — reusable adapter configurations independent of any specific agent role

These can be mixed into existing companies. Download an agent, slot it into your org, assign a manager, go.

## Core Features

### Browse & Discover

The homepage surfaces companies across several dimensions:

- **Featured** — editorially curated, high-quality templates
- **Popular** — ranked by downloads, stars, and forks
- **Recent** — latest published or updated
- **Categories** — browseable by use case (see Categories below)

Each listing shows: name, short description, org size (agent count), category, adapter types used, star count, download count, and a mini org chart preview.

### Search

Search is **semantic, not keyword-only.** Powered by vector embeddings so you can search by intent:

- "marketing agency that runs facebook ads" → finds relevant company templates even if those exact words aren't in the title
- "small dev team for building APIs" → finds lean engineering orgs
- "content pipeline with writers and editors" → finds content studio templates

Also supports filtering by: category, agent count range, adapter types, star count, recency.

### Company Detail Page

Clicking into a company template shows:

- **Full description** — what this company does, how it operates, what to expect
- **Interactive org chart** — visual tree of every agent with role, title, and capabilities
- **Agent list** — expandable details for each agent (adapter type, config summary, role description)
- **Seed tasks** — the starter initiatives and tasks included
- **Budget overview** — suggested cost structure
- **Install command** — one-line CLI command to download and create
- **Version history** — changelog, semver, previous versions available
- **Community** — stars, comments, forks count

### Install & Fork

Two ways to use a template:

**Install (fresh start):**
```
paperclip install cliphub:<publisher>/<company-slug>
```
Downloads the template and creates a new company in your local Bizbox instance. You add your own API keys, set budgets, customize agents, and hit go.

**Fork:**
Forking creates a copy of the template under your own ClipHub account. You can modify it, republish it as your own variant, and the fork lineage is tracked. This enables evolutionary improvement — someone publishes a marketing agency, you fork it, add a social media team, republish.

### Stars & Comments

- **Stars** — bookmark and signal quality. Star count is a primary ranking signal.
- **Comments** — threaded discussion on each listing. Ask questions, share results, suggest improvements.

### Download Counts & Signals

Every install is counted. The registry tracks:

- Total downloads (all time)
- Downloads per version
- Fork count
- Star count

These signals feed into search ranking and discovery.

## Publishing

### Who Can Publish

Anyone with a GitHub account can publish to ClipHub. Authentication is via GitHub OAuth.

### How to Publish

From within Bizbox, export your company as a template, then publish:

```
paperclip export --template my-company
paperclip publish cliphub my-company
```

Or use the web UI to upload a template export directly.

### What You Provide

When publishing, you specify:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | yes | URL-safe identifier (e.g. `lean-dev-shop`) |
| `name` | yes | Display name |
| `description` | yes | What this company does and who it's for |
| `category` | yes | Primary category (see below) |
| `tags` | no | Additional tags for discovery |
| `version` | yes | Semver (e.g. `1.0.0`) |
| `changelog` | no | What changed in this version |
| `readme` | no | Extended documentation (markdown) |
| `license` | no | Usage terms |

### Versioning

Templates use semantic versioning. Each publish creates an immutable version. Users can install any version or default to `latest`. Version history and changelogs are visible on the detail page.

### The `sync` Command

For power users who maintain multiple templates:

```
paperclip cliphub sync
```

Scans your local exported templates and publishes any that are new or updated. Useful for maintaining a portfolio of company templates from a single repo.

## Categories

Company templates are organized by use case:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Software Development** | Full-stack dev shop, API development team, mobile app studio |
| **Marketing & Growth** | Performance marketing agency, content marketing team, SEO shop |
| **Content & Media** | Content studio, podcast production, newsletter operation |
| **Research & Analysis** | Market research firm, competitive intelligence, data analysis team |
| **Operations** | Customer support org, internal ops team, QA/testing shop |
| **Sales** | Outbound sales team, lead generation, account management |
| **Finance & Legal** | Bookkeeping service, compliance monitoring, financial analysis |
| **Creative** | Design agency, copywriting studio, brand development |
| **General Purpose** | Starter templates, minimal orgs, single-agent setups |

Categories are not exclusive — a template can have one primary category plus tags for cross-cutting concerns.

## Moderation & Trust

### Verified Publishers

Publishers who meet certain thresholds (account age, published templates with good signals) earn a verified badge. Verified templates rank higher in search.

### Security Review

Company templates contain adapter configurations, which may include executable commands (process adapter) or webhook URLs (HTTP adapter). The moderation system:

1. **Automated scanning** — checks adapter configs for suspicious patterns (arbitrary code execution, exfiltration URLs, credential harvesting)
2. **Community reporting** — any signed-in user can flag a template. Auto-hidden after multiple reports pending review.
3. **Manual review** — moderators can approve, reject, or request changes

### Account Gating

New accounts have a waiting period before they can publish. This prevents drive-by spam.

## Architecture

ClipHub is a **separate service** from Bizbox itself. Bizbox is self-hosted; ClipHub is a hosted registry that Bizbox instances talk to.

### Integration Points

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| **ClipHub Web** | Browse, search, discover, comment, star — the website |
| **ClipHub API** | Registry API for publishing, downloading, searching programmatically |
| **Bizbox CLI** | `paperclipai install`, `paperclipai publish`, `paperclipai cliphub sync` — built into Bizbox |
| **Bizbox UI** | "Browse ClipHub" panel in the Bizbox web UI for discovering templates without leaving the app |

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite (consistent with Bizbox) |
| Backend | TypeScript + Hono (consistent with Bizbox) |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Search | Vector embeddings for semantic search |
| Auth | GitHub OAuth |
| Storage | Template zips stored in object storage (S3 or equivalent) |

## Relationship to Bizbox

ClipHub is **not required** to use Bizbox. You can build companies entirely from scratch without ever touching ClipHub. But ClipHub dramatically lowers the barrier to entry:

- **New users** get a working company in minutes instead of hours
- **Experienced users** share proven configurations with the community
- **The ecosystem** compounds — every good template makes the next company easier to build

ClipHub is to Bizbox what a package registry is to a language runtime: optional, but transformative.
